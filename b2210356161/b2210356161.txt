Hello, I'm İbrahim. I came to Hacettepe CMPE from TEDU Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I'm interested in programming for more than 10 years. My interest started with a forum script which is SMF. I created my first website with SMF when I was 12 years old on a free hosting and free domain (ibo.eu5.org). After than I improved myself individualy till now. I used more than 10 (nearly 13) programming languages on my projects. Generally, I use Java and Javascript because I spent a lot of time on these and I feel I can do whatever I want with them. Now, I'm a Computer Engineering student and it feels better to know I can improve myself too much. Thanks.

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website; I will not share my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have already been asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
